## Pre-con exercises: Less Clicking, More Coding! Azure Data Platform Development Using Infrastructure as Code

### Getting started - tooling

You will need your favorite IDE for creating and editing your Terraform files. If you don't have one installed yet, Visual Studio Code is convenient to use. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you are using VS Code, I also recommend to Install the HashiCorp Terraform extension.

In addition you will need Terrform, find the instructions [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/azure-get-started) for all major operating systems.

Lastly, you need Azure CLI, which you can download from [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
